# Motivation

## Purpose 
HTP(House, Tree, Person) test is non-verbal psychological test which is part of art therapy. It allows in-depth psychological diagnosis since the therapist is able to see client's unconscious world beyond language expression through the picture of his or her house, tree, and person drawings. Because each part of the drawing abstractly depicts the human unconscious, examining and interpreting every part of drawings requires high-level skill and a lot of experience. The HTP-related contents are vast and unsystematic, so counselors cannot easily learn and use them. This app has been developed so that the counselor can easily see the necessary information by dividing the essential HTP related contents into three main categories. 

## Data Structure
The contents of art therapy book [1] were summarized with my own expression.
- Main categories: House, Tree, Person
- Sub-categories: six for each main category
	- House	: Chimney, Roof, Stair/Path, Door, Window, Wall
	- Tree		: Title, Crown, Leaf, Branch, Trunk, Roof
	- Person	: Head, Mouth/Nose/Eye, Arm, Face/Neck, ETC, Leg
- Each sub-category has from 2 to 4 detailed categories.
- The details for Diagnosis aid will be displayed once detailed category is selected.

The below is data structure diagram. This diagram was more clearly depicted and explained at [File Map](#file-map) section.
![Data Tree](https://github.com/kkhese/HTPFin/blob/master/Images/DataStructure.jpg?raw=true)

## Intended Users
 If users need to use this application for practical HTP diagnosis, it is highly recommended to go through the tutorial at the home screen. Otherwise user can simply navigate the contents of application for obtaining required information about HTP diagnosis.
 - Professionals: Psychoanalyst, Art therapist, 
 - Amateur: Counselor or student learning HTP
 - Third-party: general public with a strong interest in HTP test

A detailed description of the HTP diagnostics is contained within .js files in the lowest level structure.
